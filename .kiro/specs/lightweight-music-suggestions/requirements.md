# Lightweight Music Suggestion System - Requirements

## Introduction

This feature implements a lightweight, AI-friendly music suggestion system for the music app that learns user preferences through onboarding and behavioral tracking. The system provides personalized song recommendations in a 4×4 grid layout matching the existing "Quick Picks" UI, using pure Kotlin logic without ML dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Onboarding System

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to select my music preferences during first launch, so that I receive personalized recommendations immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user launches the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL display an onboarding screen
2. WHEN the onboarding screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide genre selection options (Pop, Rock, Hip Hop, Classical, Electronic, Jazz, Country, R&B, Indie)
3. WHEN the onboarding screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide language selection options (English, Hindi, Spanish, Other)
4. WHEN the onboarding screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide mood preference options (Energetic, Chill, Focus, Party)
5. WHEN a user completes onboarding THEN the system SHALL save preferences to SharedPreferences
6. WHEN a user completes onboarding THEN the system SHALL mark onboarding as complete
7. WHEN onboarding is complete THEN the system SHALL navigate to the main app interface

### Requirement 2: Preference Management System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my music preferences, so that I can update my tastes over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preferences are saved THEN the system SHALL store them in SharedPreferences using a structured data format
2. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load existing preferences if available
3. WHEN a user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide an option to edit preferences
4. WHEN preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes to future recommendations
5. WHEN preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing data

### Requirement 3: Behavioral Tracking System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to learn from my listening behavior, so that recommendations improve over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user plays a song THEN the system SHALL increment the play count for that song
2. WHEN a user likes a song THEN the system SHALL record the like status and increment like count
3. WHEN a user skips a song THEN the system SHALL increment the skip count for that song
4. WHEN a user adds a song to a playlist THEN the system SHALL record the playlist association
5. WHEN behavioral data is recorded THEN the system SHALL store it in Room database
6. WHEN behavioral data is recorded THEN the system SHALL include timestamp information
7. WHEN behavioral data reaches storage limits THEN the system SHALL clean old data automatically

### Requirement 4: Recommendation Engine

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see personalized song recommendations, so that I can discover music I'll enjoy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL use 80% weight for onboarding preferences
2. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL use 20% weight for recent behavioral data
3. WHEN insufficient behavioral data exists THEN the system SHALL fallback to popular content filtered by user preferences
4. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL return exactly 16 songs
5. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicate songs in the same session
6. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL use YouTube API for song fetching
7. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL rank results using a scoring algorithm

### Requirement 5: Dynamic Learning System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the recommendation system to adapt to my changing preferences, so that suggestions stay relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user frequently skips songs from a genre THEN the system SHALL reduce that genre's weight automatically
2. WHEN a user frequently likes songs from a genre THEN the system SHALL increase that genre's weight automatically
3. WHEN weight adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL use configurable thresholds
4. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL perform periodic weight updates based on recent activity
5. WHEN weight updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain minimum thresholds to prevent complete genre elimination
6. WHEN learning updates are applied THEN the system SHALL persist the updated weights locally

### Requirement 6: Personalized Recommendations UI

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my personalized recommendations in a familiar interface, so that I can easily browse and interact with suggested songs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL show them in a 4×4 grid layout
2. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL match the existing "Quick Picks" UI design
3. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL enable sticky horizontal scrolling
4. WHEN displaying song cards THEN the system SHALL show cover art, title, artist, and action buttons
5. WHEN a user interacts with a recommended song THEN the system SHALL immediately update behavioral tracking
6. WHEN recommendations are refreshed THEN the system SHALL provide smooth UI transitions
7. WHEN no recommendations are available THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback content

### Requirement 7: Performance and Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want the recommendation system to be fast and lightweight, so that it doesn't impact app performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL use no more than 2MB additional memory
2. WHEN storing user data THEN it SHALL use no more than 50KB storage for preferences
3. WHEN generating recommendations THEN it SHALL complete within 2 seconds
4. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL use only pure Kotlin logic without ML dependencies
5. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL work offline for cached recommendations
6. WHEN cleaning old data THEN it SHALL maintain optimal database performance
7. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize without blocking the main thread

### Requirement 8: Data Privacy and Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want control over my data and privacy, so that I feel secure using the recommendation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL keep all data locally on device
2. WHEN user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL provide complete data clearing functionality
3. WHEN tracking behavior THEN the system SHALL only collect essential interaction data
4. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL not transmit personal data to external services
5. WHEN using external APIs THEN the system SHALL only send anonymous search queries
6. WHEN user opts out THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation to basic functionality
