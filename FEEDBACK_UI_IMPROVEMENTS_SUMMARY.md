- Improved text field handling for message input
- Fixed keyboard options and input validation
- Better placeholder text and labels

**Auto Data Collection:**
- Device info is automatically collected and displayed to user
- No manual input required for technical information

### 2. UserFeedback Model Updates ✅

**Data Structure Changes:**
- Added optional `email` field to UserFeedback model
- Removed `isAnonymous` field (replaced with optional email)
- Updated Firestore mapping to handle new structure

**Validation Improvements:**

- Better error handling and user feedback
- Maintains existing validation for rating and message

### 4. ValidationUtils Updates ✅

**Email Validation:**
- Added `isValidEmail()` method with proper regex pattern
- Updated `validateUserFeedback()` to handle optional email

**Better Error Messages:**
- Clear validation messages for invalid email formats
- Proper handling of empty/whitespace-only emails

### 5. UI/UX Improvements ✅

**Better User Experience:**
- Simplified workflow - no complex toggles or manual category selection
- Clear visual hierarchy with improved typography
- Better spacing and component sizing
- More intuitive form flow

**Accessibility:**
- Larger touch targets for star rating
- Better contrast and visual feedback
- Clear labels and placeholder text

## Technical Validation

### Build Status ✅
- All code compiles successfully without errors
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Proper error handling and validation

### Code Quality ✅
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns
- Proper separation of concerns
- Clean, maintainable code structure

### Backward Compatibility ✅
- Existing feedback data structure remains compatible
- Graceful handling of missing email field in existing data
- No breaking changes to repository or database layer

## Issues Addressed

1. **Description input box not working properly** ✅
   - Fixed text input handling in both FeedbackBottomSheet and FeedbackScreen
   - Improved keyboard options and validation

2. **Manual category input removed** ✅
   - Simplified UI by removing category selection (auto-detection planned for bug reports)
   - Focus on essential feedback collection

3. **Email field made optional without anonymous button** ✅
   - Clean implementation of optional email field
   - No confusing anonymous toggle

4. **Auto-fetch device information** ✅
   - Device info automatically collected and displayed
   - User informed about what data is included

5. **Bottom sheet display issues** ✅
   - Improved ModalBottomSheet implementation
   - Better layout and spacing
   - Fixed potential rendering issues

## Next Steps

For complete implementation of the original requirements, the following would need to be addressed in future tasks:

1. **Auto screen name detection for bug reports** (requires ScreenDetector implementation)
2. **Smart category selection based on screen context** (requires screen-to-category mapping)
3. **Shake detection improvements** (requires enhanced sensor handling)

The current implementation focuses on the feedback UI improvements and provides a solid foundation for the remaining auto-detection features.
