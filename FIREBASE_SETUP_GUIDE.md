# üî• Complete Firebase Setup Guide for Bug Reports & Feedback

## üìã Overview

This guide will help you set up Firebase Firestore to store bug reports and user feedback from your Android app.

## üöÄ Step 1: Firebase Project Setup

### 1.1 Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project" or "Add project"
3. Enter your project name (e.g., "favtunes-app")
4. Enable Google Analytics (recommended)
5. Choose or create a Google Analytics account
6. Click "Create project"

### 1.2 Add Android App to Firebase

1. In your Firebase project, click "Add app" ‚Üí Android icon
2. Enter your Android package name: `com.shaadow.tunes`
3. Enter app nickname: "FavTunes"
4. Enter SHA-1 certificate fingerprint (optional but recommended for auth)
5. Click "Register app"
6. Download `google-services.json`
7. Place it in your `app/` directory

### 1.3 Configure Firebase SDK (Already Done)

Your app already has Firebase configured, but verify these files exist:

- `app/google-services.json` ‚úÖ
- Firebase dependencies in `app/build.gradle` ‚úÖ

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 2: Create Firestore Database

### 2.1 Enable Firestore

1. In Firebase Console, go to "Firestore Database"
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (we'll add security rules later)
4. Select a location (choose closest to your users)
5. Click "Done"

### 2.2 Create Collections

**Important**: Firestore collections are created automatically when you first write data to them. However, you can create them manually:

#### Create `bug_reports` Collection:

1. In Firestore Console, click "Start collection"
2. Collection ID: `bug_reports`
3. Add a sample document:
   - Document ID: `sample_bug_report`
   - Fields:
     ```
     title: "Sample Bug Report"
     description: "This is a sample bug report"
     severity: "MEDIUM"
     category: "UI"
     deviceInfo: {
       deviceModel: "Sample Device",
       osVersion: "Android 13",
       appVersion: "1.0.0"
     }
     appVersion: "1.0.0"
     timestamp: [Current timestamp]
     userId: "sample_user"
     ```
4. Click "Save"

#### Create `user_feedback` Collection:

1. Click "Start collection"
2. Collection ID: `user_feedback`
3. Add a sample document:
   - Document ID: `sample_feedback`
   - Fields:
     ```
     rating: 5
     category: "GENERAL"
     message: "Great app!"
     deviceInfo: {
       deviceModel: "Sample Device",
       osVersion: "Android 13",
       appVersion: "1.0.0"
     }
     appVersion: "1.0.0"
     timestamp: [Current timestamp]
     isAnonymous: true
     userId: "sample_user"
     ```
4. Click "Save"

## üîí Step 3: Deploy Security Rules

### 3.1 Install Firebase CLI

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### 3.2 Login to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
```

### 3.3 Initialize Firebase in Your Project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
firebase init firestore
```

- Select your Firebase project
- Keep default Firestore rules file: `firestore.rules`
- Keep default Firestore indexes file: `firestore.indexes.json`

### 3.4 Deploy Security Rules

The `firestore.rules` file is already created in your project. Deploy it:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 3.5 Verify Rules Deployment

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules
2. You should see your custom rules deployed
3. Test the rules using the Rules Playground

## üìä Step 4: Set Up Indexes (Optional but Recommended)

### 4.1 Create Composite Indexes

Add these to your `firestore.indexes.json`:

```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "bug_reports",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "timestamp", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "bug_reports",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "severity", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "timestamp", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "user_feedback",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "timestamp", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "user_feedback",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "rating", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "timestamp", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "fieldOverrides": []
}
```

### 4.2 Deploy Indexes

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

## üîß Step 5: Test Your Setup

### 5.1 Test from Android App

1. Build and run your app
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Bug Report
3. Fill out the form and submit
4. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database
5. You should see your bug report in the `bug_reports` collection

### 5.2 Test Feedback

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Feedback
2. Rate the app and write feedback
3. Submit the feedback
4. Check the `user_feedback` collection in Firestore

## üë®‚Äçüíº Step 6: Set Up Admin Access (Optional)

### 6.1 Create Admin User

In Firestore Console, create a new collection:

1. Collection ID: `admin_users`
2. Document ID: Your user ID (or email)
3. Fields:
   ```
   role: "admin"
   email: "your-email@example.com"
   createdAt: [Current timestamp]
   ```

### 6.2 Admin Capabilities

Admin users can:

- Read all bug reports and feedback
- View analytics and trends
- Export data for analysis

## üìà Step 7: Monitor and Analytics

### 7.1 Set Up Usage Monitoring

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Usage
2. Monitor reads, writes, and storage usage
3. Set up billing alerts if needed

### 7.2 Set Up Performance Monitoring

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Performance
2. Enable Performance Monitoring
3. Monitor app performance and Firestore query performance

## üö® Step 8: Important Security Considerations

### 8.1 Review Security Rules

- Anonymous submissions are allowed but validated
- Users can only read their own data
- Admin access is controlled via `admin_users` collection

### 8.2 Rate Limiting

- Basic rate limiting is in security rules (60 seconds between submissions)
- Consider implementing server-side rate limiting for production

### 8.3 Data Privacy

- Device info collection is privacy-safe
- No personal information is collected without consent
- Anonymous submissions are truly anonymous

## üîç Step 9: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "Permission denied" errors:

- Check security rules are deployed
- Verify user authentication state
- Check document structure matches validation rules

#### Data not appearing:

- Check network connectivity
- Verify Firestore rules allow writes
- Check app logs for errors

#### Offline functionality not working:

- Ensure Firestore offline persistence is enabled (it is by default)
- Check Room database setup for local queuing

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check current rules
firebase firestore:rules:get

# Test rules locally
firebase emulators:start --only firestore

# View logs
firebase functions:log
```
