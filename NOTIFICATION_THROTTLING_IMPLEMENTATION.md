# Notification Throttling Implementation

## Problem Solved
You were receiving 3 local notifications at the same time, which created a poor user experience. This implementation ensures there's at least a 2-3 hour gap between local notifications.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced IntelligentNotificationScheduler
- **Minimum Gap**: 2 hours between local notifications (was 30 minutes)
- **Preferred Gap**: 3 hours for optimal user experience
- **Separate Tracking**: Local notifications vs push notifications (Firebase/OneSignal)
- **Smart Scheduling**: Respects user behavior patterns while enforcing gaps

### 2. Updated FavTunesNotificationManager
- **Throttle-Aware Scheduling**: All workers check throttling before delivery
- **Push Notification Bypass**: Firebase/OneSignal notifications don't affect local notification timing
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time throttle status checking
- **Intelligent Delays**: Automatic rescheduling when throttling is active

### 3. Worker Updates
All notification workers now:
- Check throttling status before attempting delivery
- Automatically retry if throttling is active
- Log throttling decisions for debugging
- Respect the minimum gap requirements

### 4. Monitoring & Debugging Tools
- **NotificationThrottleMonitor**: Tracks and analyzes notification timing
- **NotificationThrottleTest**: Test utility to verify throttling works
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging notification timing

## How It Works

### Local Notification Flow
1. **Request**: App requests to send a local notification
2. **Throttle Check**: System checks if minimum gap (2 hours) has passed
3. **Decision**:
   - ‚úÖ **Allow**: If gap requirement met, deliver immediately
   - ‚è≥ **Delay**: If too soon, schedule for next available slot (3 hours preferred)
   - üö´ **Block**: If daily limit reached or in quiet hours

### Push Notification Flow
1. **Receive**: Firebase/OneSignal push notification received
2. **Bypass**: Push notifications bypass local throttling completely
3. **Track**: Record push notification for analytics (doesn't affect local timing)

### Gap Enforcement
```
Last Local Notification: 10:00 AM
Next Allowed Time: 12:00 PM (2-hour minimum)
Preferred Time: 1:00 PM (3-hour preferred)
```

## Configuration

### Throttling Constants
```kotlin
private const val NOTIFICATION_COOLDOWN_MS = 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000L // 2 hours minimum
private const val PREFERRED_NOTIFICATION_GAP_MS = 3 * 60 * 60 * 1000L // 3 hours preferred
private const val MAX_DAILY_NOTIFICATIONS = 6 // Reduced from 8
```

### Priority Handling
- **HIGH**: Can reduce gap to 30 minutes (for urgent notifications)
- **NORMAL**: Respects full 2-3 hour gap
- **LOW**: Additional 1-hour delay on top of gap requirement

## Benefits

### User Experience
- ‚úÖ No more notification spam
- ‚úÖ Predictable notification timing
- ‚úÖ Respects user's attention and battery
- ‚úÖ Push notifications still work immediately

### System Performance
- ‚úÖ Reduced battery usage
- ‚úÖ Better notification engagement rates
- ‚úÖ Prevents notification fatigue
- ‚úÖ Maintains notification channel health

### Developer Benefits
- ‚úÖ Easy to monitor and debug
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging
- ‚úÖ Test utilities included
- ‚úÖ Configurable parameters

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```kotlin
val throttleTest = NotificationThrottleTest(context)

// Test rapid notifications (should be throttled)
throttleTest.simulateOriginalIssue()

// Test proper gap timing
throttleTest.testPreferredGapScenario()
```

### Monitoring
```kotlin
val monitor = NotificationThrottleMonitor(context)

// Check current status
monitor.logThrottleStatus()

// Get summary report
val summary = monitor.getThrottleSummary()

// Check for violations
val violations = monitor.checkForViolations()
```

## Logs to Watch

Look for these log tags to monitor throttling:
- `NotificationScheduler`: Core throttling decisions
- `NotificationThrottle`: Monitoring and status
- `EngagementWorker`: Engagement notification throttling
- `DailySuggestionWorker`: Music suggestion throttling
- `MarketingWorker`: Marketing notification throttling

## Example Log Output

```
D/NotificationScheduler: Local notification delivered: engagement at 10:00:00
D/NotificationThrottle: === NOTIFICATION THROTTLE STATUS ===
D/NotificationThrottle: Last local notification: 10:00:00 22/08
D/NotificationThrottle: Time since last: 0.0 hours
D/NotificationThrottle: Can deliver now: false
D/NotificationThrottle: Time until next slot: 3h 0m
D/NotificationThrottle: =====================================
```

## Result

‚úÖ **Problem Solved**: No more simultaneous local notifications
‚úÖ **Minimum 2-hour gap** enforced between local notifications
‚úÖ **Push notifications unaffected** (Firebase/OneSignal work normally)
‚úÖ **Comprehensive monitoring** and debugging tools included
‚úÖ **Backward compatible** with existing notification system
